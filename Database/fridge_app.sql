Stuff if desired.  Don’t pre-stuff your turkey; mix and stuff ingredients immediately before roasting. Tossing in a few pieces of cut fruit or herbs is not considered \'stuffing.\'  Stuffing usually means filling up the cavity with about ¾ cup stuffing per pound of turkey.&&Rub the entire bird with olive oil or butter. Doctor up your bird with whatever special seasonings you wish.  I always use poultry seasoning. Finish with a good sprinkle of seasoning salt and black pepper.&&I highly recommend using a wired thermometer so you can watch the temperature without lifting the lid.  Your turkey will be done much earlier than the estimated cook time, so keep a sharp eye on that thermometer.  If using a pop-up turkey plug type thermometer, those little pop-ups stick sometimes so you should really use two of them.&&Put the rack into the insert pan and make sure the handles are up, not tucked below.  Put the bird in the insert pan on top of the rack.  Don’t add water to the pan. Put the insert pan back into the roasting pan.  If your roaster doesn\'t have an insert pan, it\'s ok - just be very careful putting the bird into that hot oven, you don\'t want to burn your hands on the sides of the oven! Cover.&&Roast at highest setting for 30 minutes.  The butter/oil, seasonings and the searing time will make the skin beautifully browned and perfect!&&After 30 minutes, turn the oven temperature down to 325.&&The turkey will self-baste if you do not lift the lid, so you don\'t have to baste it every 20 minutes like you do in your conventional oven. DO NOT LIFT LID during cooking time!  Lifting the lid will increase cooking time because roaster ovens lose their heat unlike regular ovens.   I\'ve read that roaster ovens effectively \'steam\' the turkey making the meat come out  --  well, steamed.  This is not true as you will find out.  Similar to the roasted chickens you can get at your supermarket, the bird will come out moist and perfectly roasted.  Why do you think they call it a Roaster Oven?.&&\nFigure your total cooking time from the time you first put the bird in the roaster.  The Butterball website has a great calculator:\n&&http://www.butterball.com/calculators-and-conversions.&&FINAL TEMPERATURE FOR SAFETY AND DONENESS IS: 180 DEGREES IN THIGH AND 165 DEGREES IN BREAST AND STUFFING. Juices should be clear, not pink.&&Check your turkey EARLY.  Really start watching the temp an hour before it\'s supposed to be done. Your turkey will almost certainly be done before the suggested cooking time.  Watch your wired meat thermometer.  If using a pop-up turkey plug type thermometer, check by lifting the lid quickly so the oven doesn’t lose its heat.  If necessary, check after another 30 minutes, but I doubt you\'ll have to do that.

Warm water will rise the dough to the right point for storage in about 2 hours.  With cold water it will need 3-4 hours.&&Add the yeast to the water in a 5 quart bowl or, preferably, in a resealable, lidded (not airtight) plastic food container or food-grade bucket.  Don\'t worry about getting it all to dissolve.&&Mix in the flour and salt - kneading is unnecessary.  Add all of the flour at once, measuring it in with dry-ingredient measuring cups, by gently scooping up the flour, then sweeping the top level with a knife or spatula.  Don\'t press down into the flour as you scoop or you\'ll throw off the measurement.  Mix with a wooden spoon, a high-capacity food processor (14 cups or larger) fitted with the dough attachment, or a heavy duty stand mixer fitted with the dough hook until the mixture is uniform.  If you\'re hand mixing and it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, you can reach into your mixing vessel with very wet hands and press the mixture together.  Don\'t knead, it isn\'t necessary.  You\'re finished when everything is uniformly moist, without dry patches.  It takes a few minutes, and will yield a dough that is wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container.&&Allow to rise.  Cover with lid (not airtight or it could explode the lid off).  Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse (or at least flattens on the top), approx 2 hours, depending on room temperature, and initial water temperature  Longer rising times, up to 5 hours, won\'t harm the result.&&You can use a portion of the dough any time after this period.  Fully refrigerated dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature.&&\nOn Baking Day:\n&&prepare your loaf tin, tray, or whatever you\'re baking it in/on.  Sprinkle the surface of your refrigerated dough with four.  Pull up and cut of a grapefruit-size piece of dough (c 1 lb), using a serrated knife.&&Hold the mass of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it won\'t stick to your hands.  Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all 4 sides, rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go.  Most of the dusting flour will fall off - that\'s fine, it isn\'t meant to be incorporated.  The bottom of the loaf may appear to be a collection of bunched ends, but it will sort itself out during resting and baking.&&The correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive.  The entire process should take no more than 30 - 60 seconds.&&Rest the loaf and let it rise in the form, on the tray/pizza peel, for about 40 minutes  Depending on the age of the dough, you may not see much rise during this period.  That\'s fine, more rising will occur during baking.&&Twenty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450°F  Place an empty broiler tray for holding water on any other shelf that won\'t interfere with the rising bread.&&Dust and Slash.  Dust the top of the loaf liberally with flour, which will allow the slashing knife to pass without sticking.  Slash a quarter inch deep cross, diagonal lines, or tic-tac-toe pattern on top using a serrated knife.&&After a 20 min preheat you\'re ready to bake, even though the oven thermometer won\'t be at full temperature yet.  Put your loaf in the oven.
